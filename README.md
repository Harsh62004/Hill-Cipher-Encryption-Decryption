# Hill-Cipher Encryption/Decryption
- The Hill Cipher was developed by ‘Lester Hill’ in 1929, setting it firmly in the classical age of cryptography.
- Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. In simple words, it is a cryptography algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt data for the  purpose of data security.
- The Hill cipher makes use of modulo arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and matrix inverses; hence, it is a more mathematical cipher than others. The Hill cipher is also a block cipher.

In this project we explore more about Hill cipher. The code in this repository encrypts the input and gives us the public key. Also it decryptes the public key using the private key matrix and gives us the original message.

This project has been made by me and 6 of my batchmates: Sankalp Bohidar, Abhi Thumar, Charith Kutikuppala, Priyank Hudka, Aditya Prajapati and Mihir Raj.
